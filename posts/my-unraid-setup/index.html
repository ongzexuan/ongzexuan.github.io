                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>In the last year or so I&rsquo;ve found myself in greater need of GPU resources for running various deep learning models. Instead of paying for AWS instances, which is the default supported choice of the various classes I was taking, I thought it made more sense to build a server to do that and pocket the AWS credits. The pros are that I appear to save money. The cons are that I have to deal with all the problems of setting up, running, and maintaining a server, but if you put a positive spin on problems self-imposed you can call it education, which I will likely pay for with the rabbit-hole-ism of such projects that are likely to end up costing more in the long run.</p>
<p>Anyway after putting it off for a while, experiencing a Black Friday where for the first time I bought a CPU and a pillow case for their thread counts (w.r.t to price of course), and then subsequently having some minor success setting up and running my home server, I thought I would document some parts of it here.</p>
<h3 id="choice-of-os">Choice of OS</h3>
<p>As is usually the case, I initially reached too far and felt I needed a bare metal hypervisor to do whatever it was I wanted to do. I went with Proxmox because it was supposedly simple and easy, but my inexperience with such networking work left me only able to run a few VMs and not much else.</p>
<p>After an embarssing defeat by the networking gang, I settled for turning the server into a NAS, to backup some photos and data. It turns out that NASes these days can run containers and VMs, which is a pleasant surprise. Unraid came out as a simpler choice, with a free license for 30 days, thereafter until shutdown, which was forcibly imposed on me when a tree fell on my power line during a storm (if you look closely at the picture above you&rsquo;ll see that I have a legit license now).</p>
<h3 id="computationally-heavy-workloads-are-gateway-drugs">Computationally Heavy Workloads are Gateway Drugs</h3>
<p>How does one get from running some models on another machine to setting up another server entirely? The rabbit hole works approximately as follows:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>I want to stop paying for AWS (which I just realized seems to be a recurring theme on this page).</li>
<li>But I need a machine to run models, preferably not my main machine so I could do other things while waiting.</li>
<li>I need another machine (oh look let&rsquo;s conveniently buy a new machine on Black Friday so we can obsolete the old one and make it a server)</li>
<li>Wait we can have a server? Now we can run multiple services on the server!</li>
<li>Let&rsquo;s&hellip; attempt to do that the correct way by running multiple containers/VMs.</li>
<li>Ok I need a hypervisor.</li>
<li>Do I really need a hypervisor for running deep learning models?</li>
<li>Yes. Actually no. Ok yes.</li>
<li>Now let me add lots of services to justify having put a hypervisor on this machine.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what-it-does">What It Does</h3>
<p>Having run the server for almost half a year now, here&rsquo;s a number of things that the server does do, and quite effectively so.</p>
<ol>
<li>Runs a music streaming server (Airsonic) so I can stop paying for Spotify.</li>
<li>Runs a bunch of Scrapy bots to collect data to build datasets so that I can stop paying for ScrapingHub and S3.</li>
<li>Runs a VPN so that I can fix and access the network from anywhere.</li>
<li>Runs an Apache Airflow VM for overkill scheduling of jobs that need to run on a regular-ish basis.</li>
<li>Runs a few databases for personal data collection (I collate all my credit card data in a single place here, but that&rsquo;s a post for another time), and for school work.</li>
<li>Backup my data, work like a NAS like, what it was invented for.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what-it-doesnt-do">What It Doesn&rsquo;t Do</h3>
<ol>
<li>Run deep learning models</li>
</ol>
<p>It turns out the original use case has dwindled in value since the idea was mooted (to myself). I still run a model or two every now and then, but not at the frequency that I had originally anticipated, and certainly not at a level that justifies an external machine for it. Oops, but hey we have a fancy server now!</p>
<h3 id="i-save-money-right">I Save Money&hellip; Right?</h3>
<p>I can say with certainty that the reduction of OPEX from unsubscribing from various online subscriptions has definitely saved me money. Furthermore, the place I currently stay in has a fixed electricity bill, so there&rsquo;s no marginal electrical expense from this server.</p>
<p>That being said, the OPEX costs have been convereted into CAPEX, which seems to be the opposite of the general trend these days. I lost a cache drive the other day, and while replacing it was easy and painless (slide in a new drive and turn on the drive array), it of course cost some money, which sort of set me back 6 months of supposed savings.</p>
<p>A common response when I tell people that I go through the trouble of doing all this so that I can unsubscribe from Spotify is that it&rsquo;s far more trouble than it is worth, especially when you consider the value of my free time. I have to say I wholeheartedly agree (especially if it&rsquo;s just for Spotify), and it sure felt that way for the most part when I started doing this. However, since setting up my Unraid server I&rsquo;ve found it really easy to deploy new services for any new projects I may have, non-business of course. Need a new database? Just spin up a new container or VM. Need a new backup location for service X? Just create a new folder in the NAS. This feels like a much cleaner separation of work with respect to my personal computer. It&rsquo;s also really easy to operationalize some script which would have otherwise been a one-off function to be scheduled manually. For example, I have triggers that upload a copy of my music to YouTube Music (previously Google Play Music) whenever new data comes in.</p>
<h3 id="more-stuff">More Stuff</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go into greater detail about some of the more interesting things I&rsquo;m running on this machine in subsequent posts.</p>
